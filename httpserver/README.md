This creates simple httpserver. It uses user's WLAN to create hotspot and user can select the directory which he wants to share. Any other user can connect to this hotspot and only donload files from the link generated. More features will be added later to make it fully functional like ShareIt.
It works only in Windows, support for other OS will be added in future.
